\begin{lemmaB}\label{thm:cp-progress-beta}
  If $\seq[{ \cpPlug{G}{P_1 \dots P_n} }]{ \Gamma }$, and some \tm{P_i} and
  \tm{P_j}, on different sides of at least one cut, act on the same bound
  channel \tm{x}, then there exist \tm{E}, \tm{E_i} and \tm{E_j} such that 
  \(
  \tm{\cpPlug{G}{P_1 \dots P_n}} =
  \tm{\cpPlug{E}{\cpCut{x}{\cpPlug{E_i}{P_i}}{\cpPlug{E_j}{P_j}}}}
  \).
\end{lemmaB}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of \tm{G}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Case \tm{\cpCut{x}{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1\dots P_i\dots P_m}}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1}\dots P_j\dots P_n}}}. 
    \\
    \(\arraycolsep=0pt\begin{array}[t]{lll}
      \text{Let}&\ \tm{E}  &\ :=\ \tm{\Box}, \\
                &\ \tm{E_i}&\ :=\ \tm{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1\dots P_{i-1},\Box,P_{i+1}\dots P_m}}, \\
                &\ \tm{E_j}&\ :=\ \tm{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1}\dots P_{j-1},\Box,P_{j+1}\dots P_n}}.
    \end{array}\)
    \\[1ex]
    By reflexivity.
  \item
    Case \tm{\cpCut{x}{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1\dots P_j\dots P_m}}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1}\dots P_i\dots P_n}}}.
    \\
    As above.
  \item
    Case \tm{\cpCut{y}{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1\dots P_i\dots P_j\dots P_m}}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1}\dots P_n}}}. \\
    Case \tm{\cpCut{y}{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1\dots P_m}}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1}\dots P_i\dots P_j\dots P_n}}}.
    \\
    We obtain \tm{E}, \tm{E_1} and \tm{E_2} from the induction hypothesis and
    \cref{thm:cp-preservation-equiv}, and then prepend either
    \tm{\cpCut{y}{\Box}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1}\dots P_n}}} or
    \tm{\cpCut{y}{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1\dots P_m}}{\Box}} to \tm{E}.
    The desired equality follows by congruence.
  \end{itemize}
  The case for \tm{\Box} is excluded because $n > 1$.
  The cases in which \tm{P_i} and \tm{P_j} are on the \emph{same} side of the
  cut, but the cut binds \tm{x}, and the cases in which \tm{P_i} and \tm{P_j}
  are on different sides of the cut, but the cut binds some other channel
  \tm{y}, are excluded by the type system.
